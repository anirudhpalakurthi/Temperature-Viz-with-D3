# Delving into Data-Driven Documents

Welcome to my first D3 project! This project demonstrates very basic functionality, making API calls to TomorrowAPI.io and visualizing the next 24 hours of precipitation probability using D3.js.

## Project Overview

This project serves as an introduction to working with APIs and data visualization using D3.js. It fetches data from TomorrowAPI.io, which provides weather forecasts, and displays the precipitation probability for the next 24 hours in a graphical format.

## Features

- Makes API calls to TomorrowAPI.io to retrieve weather forecast data.
- Uses D3.js to visualize the next 24 hours of precipitation probability.
- Provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to view weather information.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. Install any necessary dependencies.
4. Run the project locally using a development server.
5. Access the application in your web browser to view the weather forecast visualization.

## Dependencies

- D3.js
- Tomorrow.io (API key required)

## Future Enhancements

- Improve the visual design of the weather forecast visualization.
- Add additional weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- Implement user authentication and personalized weather forecasts.
